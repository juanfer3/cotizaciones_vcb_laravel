Each stack frame contains the 'args'\nof the called function. The function arguments can contain references to\ninstantiated objects. The references prevent the objects from being\ndestructed (until test results are eventually printed), so memory cannot be\nfreed up.\n\nWith enabled process isolation, test results are serialized in the child\nprocess and unserialized in the parent process. The stack trace of Exceptions\nmay contain objects that cannot be serialized or unserialized (e.g., PDO\nconnections). Unserializing user-space objects from the child process into\nthe parent would break the intended encapsulation of process isolation.","type":""},"modifiers":0}]},"_hash":681475149}]]
